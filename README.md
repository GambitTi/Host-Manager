# Host-Manager (BST Implementation)

A Java-based Binary Search Tree (BST) tool designed to manage host-to-IP mappings 
efficiently ($O(\log n)$ lookup). 

## Features
- **Interactive CLI:** Search for host IPs via terminal input.
- **Dynamic Updates:** If a hostname exists, the IP is updated automatically.
- **Secure:** Configured with a robust `.gitignore` to protect ELK stack credentials.

## How to Run
1. Compile: `javac *.java`
2. Run: `java HostBSTDemo`
